# leaflet-store-locator
An ongoing excercise to keep myself update with web-mapping tech. The goal is to produce a store locator based on the classic [mapbox's example](https://www.mapbox.com/guides/building-a-store-locator/),  but implemented via plain Leaflet.js

The example is live [here](http://miccferr.github.io/leaflet-store-locator/)

## List of Examples:  

- Vanilla JS (**WARNING: REFACTORING NEEDED** Very Old! So Much Ugly Code! Do Not Use! ðŸ”¥ ðŸš’)
- ReactJs based on Paul Le Cam's [react-leaflet](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet)
- React + Redux **TODO**
